Vanig Project

The world is changing, and fast. In less than 20 years, the number of people living in
extreme poverty is expected to reduce from 30% to 15%. In the next few years, over 75%
of the world’s population will own a mobile phone and have internet access. Middle classes
around the world are becoming the dominant class and their spending power is projected to
grow 3x before 2030. Billions of people live better lives and have the means to participate in
the digital economy. But, despite the evolutionary changes at the bottom of the pyramid, our
top down systems and processes seem to be stuck with inflexible technology that struggles
to meet the increasing demand of the newly emerged classes. We have a solution for that -
enter Vanig.

Vanig is a timely and ambitious project: We are sitting at the nexus of two of the most
impactful forces in today’s businesses: e-commerce and supply chains. We are deploying
blockchain technology in novel ways to sort out some of the typical issues that hamper
businesses, frustrates consumers and impede growth and economic opportunities for
everyone. Our proposition is drawn from years of experience and exposure to large scale
e-commerce systems, running and maintaining global supply chains and niche expertise
with blockchain technology.

We aim to build the world’s first integrated e-commerce supply chain ecosystem. Blockchain
technology is at the core of what we do. In particular, the effective use of smart contracts
and configurable blockchains will help us alleviate five core challenges faced by any large
scale, global supply chain:

“Our mission is to push the boundaries in innovation through the integration
of supply-chain and e-commerce by leveraging the latest in Blockchain
technology.”

1. Complete visibility and transparency of the entire chain.
2. Eliminating intermediaries.
3. Less transaction fees.
4. Effective Track and Trace mechanisms.
5. Efficient recalls.

We are also building a working ecosystem around Vanig and aim to on-board businesses
and consumers seamlessly. The utility of the Vanig platform is anchored on the provision
of a unique e-commerce system where different users, such as vendors and consumers,
meet and transact at a global scale with ease, security and transparency. Consumers and
businesses alike can benefit from economies of scale with the Vanig ecosystem at times
when economic activity amongst us is at all-time high.

We couldn’t be more excited to launch Vanig now!
